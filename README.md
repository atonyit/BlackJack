# Blackjack Game

This repository contains the code for a simple web-based Blackjack game. Utilized arrays, conditonals, if-else statements, logical operators, for loops, objects, booleans, the Math object, and functions to create my first javascript game (using html for the body and css for the styling)

## Description

Blackjack, also known as 21, is a popular card game where the goal is to draw cards that total 21 or come closer to 21 than the dealer. Players do not compete against each other. Instead, the game is played between the dealer and each player individually. For my version, no money is used, but it is displayed on the screen along with the player's name.
